## Assumed knowledge

This course assumes that you have basic proficiency with the command line / bash terminal, a text editor and simple Python scripting.
If you are unfamiliar with any of these concepts, we recommend the following tutorials:

- (linux) command line / bash [SWC Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), [ADACS Lesson](https://adacs.org.au/courses/introduction-to-bash/)
- command line text editor ([emacs](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/emacs-editor-tutorial)/[vim](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vim/index.htm#)/[nano](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/nano-editor-in-linux))
- Python scripting [SWC Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/), [ADACS Lesson](https://adacs.org.au/courses/introduction-to-python/)


## Required software



Software requirements

- A integrated development environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) or text editor of choice
  - We recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- An operating system which gives you a proper command line
  - For windows this means using something like [gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), or the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) prompt
  - For OSX or Linux the regular terminal will be fine
