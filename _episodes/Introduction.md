## Overview TODO REMOVE ADACS
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) at the request of Henry Zovaro as part of their 2023B training project.

This workshop is intended for researchers who have little or no formal computing training, but who have learned to get by via self or peer learning, and who are interested to being exposed to some best practices in computing and software development.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions.
The workshop is designed to have three lessons per day dedicated to explaining and demonstrating skills, followed by an afternoon session of skills practice where people can work on their group project.


## Conduct TODO CHANGE TO WHAT WE'RE USING

This workshop will be an inclusive and equitable space, which respects:
- the lived experience of it's attendees,
- the right for all to learn, and
- the fact that learning means making mistakes.

We ask that you follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
- Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate.
- Be considerate and respectful to others.
- Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals.
- Do not engage in tech-shaming.

See the [ASA2022 code of conduct](https://www.asa2022.org/code-of-conduct) and the [Software Carpentries code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) for more information.


## Engagement
This workshop is all about learning by doing.
We will be engaging in live coding type exercises for most of the workshop, and we will set challenges and exercises for you to complete in groups.
The more you engage with your fellow learners and the more questions that you ask, the more that you will get out of this workshop.

We will be using sticky notes for in-person participants to indicate their readiness to move on: please stick them on your laptop screen to indicate if you need help or are done and ready to move ahead.
For those joining online we'll be using emotes to indicate the same.

We will use a shared document ([etherpad]({{site.ether_pad}})) to manage and record many of our interactions.
